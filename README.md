The Move Assist and Cheat Resist Smart Chess Board

# What is Smart Chess?
Smart chess is game tracking software that keeps track of the chess game progression

It consists of a custom built game board, which consists of reed switches, LEDs, and is controlled by a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno

The board will alert if invalid move is detected or if pieces are moved out of turn, and LED indicators under each playable tile show valid moves for each piece.
